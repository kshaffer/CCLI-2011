CCLI-2011
=========

CCLI top 25 Christian worship songs, formatted for use with corpusAnalysis Python module, available from http://www.github.com/kshaffer/corpusAnalysis.

Harmonic analysis is a translation of chord symbols from the the lead sheets in the CCLI database to Roman numerals. Roots are considered, not inversions. In the very small number of cases in which they occur, cadential 6/4 chords are analyzed as V chords. Chord repetitions are reduced out, unless they cross a phrase boundary.

Phrase boundaries are marked by '|'; module boundaries (defined by Summach, things like 'Verse' or 'Chorus') are marked by '||'.

Formal analysis follows the principles put forward in Jason Summach's 2012 dissertation from Yale University, "Form in Top-20 Rock Music, 1955â€“89."
